üß† Tentative Project Name  
AutoScheduler (temporary name)

üéØ Project Goal

This project aims to automate weekly shift scheduling for businesses with multiple employees. The main objective is to reduce the time and effort supervisors spend organizing shifts by implementing a base strategy that meets employer-defined requirements.

The system will generate weekly shift plans that:
- Ensure each employee fulfills their contracted weekly hours.
- Respect manually blocked days for specific employees.
- Detect and prioritize days that may require additional staff, either manually or based on favorable weather conditions.

This will allow businesses to optimize human resources with minimal manual input, improve efficiency, and eliminate common scheduling errors.

üßë‚Äçüíº Target Users

Any business that needs to schedule employee shifts regularly. For example:
- Restaurants
- Caf√©s
- Fast food locations
- Retail stores
- Hotels

üåê Type of Application
